120 bpm 8th notes = 15 fp8
150 bpm 8th notes = 12 fp8
180 bpm 8th notes = 10 fp8

var phase_current == a value between 1 and 9 during game play
120 increase by 18 per frame
180 increase by 26 per frame

8bit Workship IDE problems

ctrl-r refreshed but could be Redo (after ctrl-z undo)
remember cursor position in each file (probably just needs focus / can't delete highlights but it remembers those)
new file placeholder text doesn't go away
various forms: enter does not submit
file order is what? (think we know now)
const values label overwrites var name in memory browser
main dropdown doesn't close after clicking dropdown item
tab makes indent -- shift-tab does not deindent
search all code for string (undefined labels are easy to find)
git status / diff
git pull changes maybe overwritten by current open file?
