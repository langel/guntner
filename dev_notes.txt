fix these:
	vampire doesn't always show hit/damage?
	brighter bg colors during boss death and hearts
	
	test - pause enemy spawns during player death animation
	test - start on end scene should go back to menu
	
	more forgiving autofire
	
	mask doesn't always give life and leave on player death
	random game reset happened in easiest mode

enemies
	muya
	ikes mom
	finger
bosses
	lazerface
	swordtner
difficulty
	?adjust xp values?
	player damage from enemies
game over glitches
player damage should use dithered transparency sprite instead of disappearing during iframes

nametable plan:
$2000 : Title Screen / Starfield / (Cut Scene Text maybe?)
$2400 : Option Screen / Starfield / HUD/dashboard

on cart load:
	draw title screen w/ verison bar
	draw option screen w/ hud
on game start:
	fill in version text with bar
	clear starfield space
on title return:
	draw title screen
	
	

STATE MACHINE
	each state has 4 subroutines
		init, render, update, shutdown
		*pointers can be to do-nothing generics
	flags
		rendering, sprite0, fade in, fade out, trip-mode, i-frames
		
		


; more problems...

; star update is based on starfield state



ability to seamlessly switch the starfield from being rendered by the background to relying on sprites
putting phase/level success messages in the middle of the screen while starfield is in sprite mode
seamlessly switch starfield back to background mode
prototype the FINAL BOSS (proof of concept) which also relies on stars as sprites
MANY new enemy flight paths
enemies that shoot! (⊙.⊙(☉̃ₒ☉)⊙.⊙)



	
FADE IN/OUT orders of operation
	used for transitions between soft_state(s)
	fade in after soft_state inits
	fade out before next soft_state inits
	scrolling menus do not need fades
	init of a soft_state means ppu rendering is off
	
FADE IN/OUT script
	fade in title screen
	fade out title/options screen
	fade in? demo game
	fade out demo game
	repeat
player hits start game
	fade out title/options screen
	fade in cut scene
	fade out cut scene
	fade in game start

RAM MAP - 2kb is so much!!

$0000 - zero page
$0100 - music data?
$0200 - OAM reference (sprite data)
$0300 - enemy data
$0400 -
$0500 -
$0600 -
$0700 -


SPRITE MAP - 64 wow :) / but over 8 on scanline bad :(

#$00       - sprite zero for splitting the screen
#$01..#$02 - player's spaceship
#$03..#$07 - 5 player bullets
#$08..#$3f - enemy sprites? (56)

                                 ENEMY_RAM   OAM_REF

get_enemy_slot_{x}_sprites: subroutine
	returns slot id if available
	returns #$ff if none available


ENEMY SPRITE TYPES

4 sprites
2 sprites
1 sprite

enemy x,y coordinates are held at OAM ref
but those are only visual coordinates

0) type
1) Health Points
2) X base
3) Y base
4) Pattern Counter
5) Animation Counter
6) Hit palette frame Counter
7) EXtra


sprite configurations
1x1 : birb
2x1 : maggs
2x2 : starglasses, skully


HUD info to include:
	score
	shields
	time
	speed (ship movement changed with select key)
	paused? (start key)
	current world/level/phase/wave `X-X` eg. 7-1, 1-3 etc.....


SHIELD CAPACITOR METER
	256 range
	16 tiles
	64 lines
	
so for every tile thats a life range of 16 translate to 4
so get the 16 range
240..255
224..239
208..223
192..207
176..191

  0.. 15




8bit Workship IDE problems

ctrl-r refreshed but could be Redo (after ctrl-z undo)
new file placeholder text doesn't go away
various forms: enter does not submit
file order is what? (think we know now)
const values label overwrites var name in memory browser
main dropdown doesn't close after clicking dropdown item
tab makes indent -- shift-tab does not deindent
search all code for string (undefined labels are easy to find)
git status / diff
git pull changes maybe overwritten by current open file?
nesdefs.dasm
	MASK_BG_CLIP should be MASK_BG_ENABLE
	MASK_SPR_CLIP should be MASK_SPR_ENABLE
