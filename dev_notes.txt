fdbe before working on crossbones/death
fda5 before working on jump table consolidation
fd4e after jump table work
fcd9 after gutting score system

77 bytes from sandbox but that makes testing a bit more annoying


fix these:

	change player bullet image position in sprite
		update collision hit box
		helps to center hit box of orbit skull shield thing
	birbs spawn closer to x pos 0
	tame starfield acceleration (maybe start much slower too)
	turbo button shouldn't hurt during r.bags?
	increase max autofire speed
	no interval spawns after final boss
	ikes mom banshee wail shriek should be in options sfx
	
	change speed with select during attract mode borked
	
	DEATHLESS!!
	
	decouple visual effects from sfx in options screen
	
	arctang loses x_hi with player death 
		best we can do is mitigate outcomes

Kaytse bugs:
	enemy spawn feels a bit cheap sometimes. i think i died a few times because of enemies hitting me at the right side of the screen (i think the stars), although they were spawning left.
	after playing the death music (song 5), the palette will turn into the one after going game over


continues --
	only if past first level
	takes player back to beginning of level
	countdown from 3 using rng chord
game over glitches

; more problems...

; star update is based on starfield state



ability to seamlessly switch the starfield from being rendered by the background to relying on sprites
putting phase/level success messages in the middle of the screen while starfield is in sprite mode
seamlessly switch starfield back to background mode

$0300 - enemy data
$0400 -
$0500 -
$0600 -
$0700 -


SPRITE MAP - 64 wow :) / but over 8 on scanline bad :(

#$00       - sprite zero for splitting the screen
#$01..#$02 - player's spaceship
#$03..#$07 - 5 player bullets
#$08..#$3f - enemy sprites? (56)

                                 ENEMY_RAM   OAM_REF

get_enemy_slot_{x}_sprites: subroutine
	returns slot id if available
	returns #$ff if none available


ENEMY SPRITE TYPES

4 sprites
2 sprites
1 sprite

enemy x,y coordinates are held at OAM ref
but those are only visual coordinates

0) type
1) Health Points
2) X base
3) Y base
4) Pattern Counter
5) Animation Counter
6) Hit palette frame Counter
7) EXtra


sprite configurations
1x1 : birb
2x1 : maggs
2x2 : starglasses, skully


HUD info to include:
	score
	shields
	time
	speed (ship movement changed with select key)
	paused? (start key)
	current world/level/phase/wave `X-X` eg. 7-1, 1-3 etc.....


SHIELD CAPACITOR METER
	256 range
	16 tiles
	64 lines
	
so for every tile thats a life range of 16 translate to 4
so get the 16 range
240..255
224..239
208..223
192..207
176..191

8bit Workship IDE problems

new file placeholder text doesn't go away
various forms: enter does not submit
file order is what? (think we know now)
collapsible directories
const values label overwrites var name in memory browser
main dropdown doesn't close after clicking dropdown item
tab makes indent -- shift-tab does not deindent
search all code for string (undefined labels are easy to find)
git status / diff
git pull changes maybe overwritten by current open file?
	refreshing browser fixes this
nesdefs.dasm
	MASK_BG_CLIP should be MASK_BG_ENABLE
	MASK_SPR_CLIP should be MASK_SPR_ENABLE
